# JavaScript Cafe Order
Welcome to the JavaScript Cafe! This is an app where you can fulfill orders for customers which are generated when you interact with the page.

## Some of the additional features:

- I want the product text to turn red when we run out of a particular product. 

- I want a feature where customers have a random amount of money, and their order is rejected if they don't have enough for the total price of the products they want to order.  

- I want a feature where every product has a 'wholesaleCost' property, and each product has a "Restock" button next to it. Clicking the restock button adds one more of that product to your stock, and subtracts the wholesaleCost from your cash. If you don't have enough cash, an alert pops up telling you that you can't restock. 

- I want a feature where if customers order eggs, they have to specify how they want them cooked: scrambled, fried, poached, etc- and then they must be given the correct kind of eggs. 

- I want a feature where if you are out of one item in the customers order, they leave without paying!  

- I want a history feature, where I can look back at the previous transactions. 

- I want a system where there is a small chance that customers will request a refund for their order, and a passive aggressive alert pops up about the quality of your products.
